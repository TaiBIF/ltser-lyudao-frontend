      "content1": "Lyudao (also known as Green Island) is the fourth largest offshore island in Taiwan. Influenced by the Kuroshio Current, Lyudao is fringed by rich tropical coral reefs. Coral reef ecosystem supports local fishery in the past and more importantly the modern tourist industry. The increasing number of tourists and the unpredictability of climate change have made Lyudao, which has long relied on the supplies from mainland Taiwan, increasingly vulnerable to human-derived and natural disturbances.",
      "content2": "Whether Lyudao can develop sustainably under the current circumstances requires the collection and analysis of long term social-ecological data. Therefore, this project will build a long-term observation platform of sociology by taking inventory of social and ecological issues, conducting environmental and ecological observations, and warehousing and openly sharing the data.",
      "content3": "Through this platform, the stakeholders can conduct research, education and discussion of issues to find collective consensus and ultimately find executable policies for the sustainable development of Lyudao."

    "mainDescription1": "The Long-term Social-Ecological Research Core Platform - Lyudao is an offshore observation platform established within the National Science and Technology Council's long-term social-ecological core observation framework. This site serves as the data management system for the observation platform, aimed at facilitating the management and public access of related data. The various features provided by this site are collectively referred to as the Service. Data provided through the Service is assumed to be made public by the data subjects themselves or disclosed as required by law. The respect and protection of personal data and privacy are governed by this policy. By continuing to use the Service, including accessing related public information, users are deemed to have explicitly consented to the following privacy policy, including compliance with usage requirements, technical specifications, and any updates to this policy.",
    "mainDescription2": "This privacy policy outlines how the Service collects, processes, and uses users' personal data. Users have the option to decide whether to provide their personal data when using the Service. However, certain features of the Service (such as data uploading) require users to provide specific personal information. If users choose not to provide this information, they may be unable to access these features.",
    "mainDescription3": "The Service’s servers are located within the Republic of China (Taiwan) and are governed by Taiwan’s Personal Data Protection Act. Users who are data subjects have the right, under this Act, to access, correct, request the cessation of processing, and delete their personal data. Data subjects may contact us using the information provided below to exercise these rights.",
    "subTitle1": "Data Collection",
    "content1": "1. When users register, the Service will request basic personal identification information, including their full name, email address, and chosen user account. Users may also provide additional identification information and background details when editing datasets, data, and project metadata. The Service will collect users' usage records, which may include, but are not limited to, IP addresses, access times, URLs accessed, HTTP referrer URLs, and details about the operating system and browser used. Once users log in, these usage records will be linked to their account data.",
    "content2": "2. When downloading specific data or species lists from the Service, users will need to provide an email address, identity, and a brief explanation for the data request through a recording mechanism. Some identification information may be automatically extracted from the user's account during this process. This recording mechanism will be used solely for internal purposes within the Service and for verification related to the Service’s operational funding. Outside these contexts, this data will not be used for any other purposes before undergoing appropriate de-identification or data quantification processing.",
    "subTitle2": "Activity Tracking",
    "content3": "3. The Service utilizes registered user accounts to offer features such as creating, uploading, modifying, and tracking datasets and projects. The user account information and timestamps of these activities will be displayed in the activity sections of the datasets and projects and may be publicly visible or followed.",
    "content4": "4. To enhance service quality, the Service employs the latest version of Google Analytics (GA4) and Google Tag Manager (GTM) for traffic analysis and program management. These tools assist website and application administrators in understanding visitor interactions with the site and application. The latest version of Google Analytics does not collect cookie information directly from users' devices. Instead, it uses a floating user ID to track behavior associated with that ID on the website. This data collection is solely for the purpose of traffic analysis and monitoring website services by the management team. The platform does not use behavioral records to identify individual visitors or record users' actual IP addresses.
